# **The Live Stream Pipeline**  

### **Description**  
Imagine tracking a car on its way from London to Birmingham in real-time. Sounds exciting, right? That's exactly what this project is about. Here's how it works:  

- **Collecting data**:  
  From IoT devices, we’ll capture live vehicle stats, GPS locations, emergency alerts, weather updates, and even camera footage.  

- **Moving the data**:  
  Tools like **Apache Kafka** and **Zookeeper** ensure this constant flow of information doesn’t hit a traffic jam.  

- **Processing the data**:  
  With **Apache Spark**, we’ll clean, analyze, and make sense of everything—fast.  

- **Storing it**:  
  All this information gets neatly organized in **AWS Redshift**, ready for use.  

- **Visualizing it**:  
  Finally, using **Power BI**, we’ll bring the data to life with easy-to-read charts and dashboards.  

### **Overview**  
This project simplifies real-time streaming from start to finish. Every phase—*from ingestion to processing to storage*—is designed to show how modern tools and cloud tech come together to solve real-world challenges.
